# Google Visitor Manager

## Overview

###### This web app provides the following functionalities:

-   A google workspace user is able to share files or folders with any email holders for a period of time not longer than a year.

-   When sharing multiple files and folders, a copy, that contains the multiple files and folders selected, will be created in your shared folder, and this copy will be shared

-   The shared file permission will be revoked automatically when the specified date comes

-   Every day at `1:00 AM`, the rows of the expired files inside your `Spreadsheet` will be deleted, and the shared file will be deleted from your shared folder.

-   Non-google users can be access to the shared file(s)
